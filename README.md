# Fraud-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

Project Overview

This project uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. It leverages transactional, client, and merchant data to construct a heterogeneous graph and train models capable of identifying fraud patterns.

Key Goals:

Preprocess and clean IBM credit card transaction dataset

Build a heterogeneous graph representing clients, merchants, and transactions

Train a GNN (custom PyTorch model + HinSAGE) for fraud detection

Evaluate model performance on training and inductive datasets

Features

âœ… Load and preprocess IBM credit card transaction dataset

âœ… Convert transactional data into a heterogeneous graph

âœ… Feature encoding for merchant, client, and transaction nodes

âœ… Train custom PyTorch GNN

âœ… Train HinSAGE representation learner

âœ… Generate embeddings for graph nodes

âœ… Fraud detection predictions and analysis

I can also convert this README into a PDF with professional formatting and placeholders for plots/graph visualizations, like the other two projects.

Do you want me to make the PDF for this one as well?

please dont put anything for me to complete like this :

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd fraud-detection-gnn

Got it! Iâ€™ll make a fully polished README without any placeholders or instructions you need to fill in. Hereâ€™s the updated version for your Fraud Detection with GNN project:
